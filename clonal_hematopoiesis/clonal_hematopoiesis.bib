abstract = {Summary
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), as evidenced by recurrent somatic mutations in leukemia-associated genes, commonly occurs among aging human hematopoietic stem cells. We analyzed deep-coverage, targeted, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of paired tumor and blood samples from 8,810 individuals to assess the frequency and clinical relevance of CH in patients with non-hematologic malignancies. We identified CH in 25% of cancer patients, with 4.5% harboring presumptive leukemia driver mutations (CH-PD). CH was associated with increased age, prior radiation therapy, and tobacco use. PPM1D and TP53 mutations were associated with prior exposure to chemotherapy. CH and CH-PD led to an increased incidence of subsequent hematologic cancers, and CH-PD was associated with shorter patient survival. These data suggest that CH occurs in an age-dependent manner and that specific perturbations can enhance fitness of clonal hematopoietic stem cells, which can impact outcome through progression to hematologic malignancies and through cell-non-autonomous effects on solid tumor biology.}

    abstract = "{Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a phenomenon caused by expansion of white blood cells descended from a single hematopoietic stem cell. While CH can be associated with leukemia and some solid tumors, the relationship between CH and lung cancer remains largely unknown. To help clarify this relationship, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 1,958 lung cancer cases and controls. Potential CH mutations were identified by a set of hierarchical filtering criteria in different exonic regions, and the associations between the number of CH mutations and clinical traits were investigated. Family history of lung cancer (FHLC) may exert diverse influences on the accumulation of CH mutations in different age groups. In younger subjects, FHLC was the strongest risk factor for CH mutations. Association analysis of genome-wide genetic variants identified dozens of genetic loci associated with CH mutations, including a candidate SNP rs2298110, which may promote CH by increasing expression of a potential leukemia promoter gene OTUD3. Hundreds of potentially novel CH mutations were identified, and smoking was found to potentially shape the CH mutational signature. Genetic variants and lung cancer risk factors, especially FHLC, correlated with CH. These analyses improve our understanding of the relationship between lung cancer and CH, and future experimental studies will be necessary to corroborate the uncovered correlations.Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data uncovers correlations between clonal hematopoiesis and lung cancer risk factors, identifies genetic variants correlated with clonal hematopoiesis, and highlights hundreds of potential novel clonal hematopoiesis mutations.}",
